# ExpressJS CRUD, MongoDB, and JWT Authentication - 


## Project Overview

In this Project, you'll master the fundamentals of ExpressJS, MongoDB, and secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Here's what you'll learn:

1. **Installation of ExpressJS**: Get started by setting up the Express.js framework and creating your first web application.

2. **Types of Routes and Implementation**: Explore different types of routes in Express.js and implement them effectively, from basic routes to more advanced routing strategies.

3. **Handling Requests and Responses**: Learn to handle HTTP requests and responses in your Express.js applications, building robust APIs and web services.

4. **Introduction to MongoDB**: Discover the world of NoSQL databases with MongoDB and understand how to connect it to your Express.js server.

5. **API Creation using Express.js and MongoDB**: Build powerful APIs for various purposes using Express.js and MongoDB, including basic CRUD operations and more.

6. **Error Handling**: Master best practices for handling errors in your applications, capturing, logging, and gracefully responding to them.

7. **Data Validation in Express.js**: Learn how to validate user input effectively to ensure data accuracy and security.

8. **Password Encryption**: Explore techniques for securely storing and verifying passwords, enhancing user data security.

9. **JSON Web Token (JWT)**: Understand the concept of JSON Web Tokens and how to use them for user authentication and authorization.

10. **JWT Verification with Middleware**: Secure your routes with JWT verification using middleware, ensuring authentication and authorization on protected routes.

11. **Authentication with JWT**: Implement user authentication using JWT, enhancing the security of your web services.



## Dependencies

This project relies on the following dependencies:

- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/): A fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.

- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv): Zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into `process.env`.

- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/): An elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.

- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/): A utility that will monitor for changes in your source code and automatically restart your server.
